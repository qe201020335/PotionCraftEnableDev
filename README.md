A mod that enables the game's developer mode and cheat codes.

## How to Install?
1. Install BepInEx if you haven't already, using an installer or manually.
2. Download the mod. 
3. Put the DLL file from the zip file into the `BepInEx/plugins` folder you can find in your game directory.

## How to Enable Dev Mode?
There are two ways:
  * (Recommended!) After the game loads, enter the cheat code [`DevModeOn`](#known-cheatcodes)<br/>
or
  * Edit the config file and change `EnableDevModeOnStart` to `true`. This will make the developer mode always active. 

When the dev mode is enabled, you will see a button at the top-left corner. Click on that will show the entire dev menu. 

**Be aware, some of the buttons and commands will CRASH YOUR GAME!**
