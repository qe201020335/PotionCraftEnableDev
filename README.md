# Potion Craft EnableDev <img src="https://i.imgur.com/qji3qtE.png" align="right">
A mod that enables the game's developer mode and cheat codes.

**By default it will enable the cheat codes but not the developer mode.**

## How to Enable Dev Mode?
There are two ways:
  * (Recommended!) After the game loads, enter the cheat code [`DevModeOn`](#known-cheatcodes)<br/>
or
  * Edit the config file and change `EnableDevModeOnStart` to `true`. This will make the developer mode always active. 

When the dev mode is enabled, you will see a button on the top-left corner. Click on that will show the entire dev menu. 

**Be aware, some of the buttons and commands will CRASH YOUR GAME!**



## Known Cheat Codes
Type the letters by keyboards or push the controller buttons
| Name  | Keyboard & Mouse | Controller & Gamepad | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| DevModeOn  | `devmodeon` | `xaxaxaybaxybaxxaxaxa` | Enables the developer mode |
